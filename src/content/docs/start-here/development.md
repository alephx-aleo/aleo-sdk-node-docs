To develop in [Aleo SDK Node](https://github.com/alephx-aleo/aleo-sdk-node), clone the SDK, install the dependencies with your package manager and modify source code in `/src`.

Note that we use `dotenv-cli` for development, please install it globally (ie. `npm i -g dotenv-cli`).

## Development
To develop with the package, we can run the following command.

```bash
# Build and run 
npm run dev
```
